## About this project

- This project was developed during one of Rocketseat's Ignite chapter challenges! The idea was to develop a website from scratch following the Figma layout using only the Chakra UI system. In this project I added some details of my own.

- Integration with Prismic CMS, where all information used on the website is stored/created.
  Added use of Next.js static system, where all routes are preloaded and cached.

This project was developed during the chapter IV from the [Ignite course](https://rocketseat.com.br/)
